# Enterprise Banking SQL Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world **enterprise banking analytics system** built using **advanced SQL**.  
It is designed to solve real-world problems in risk, fraud, marketing, and compliance.
 
The project focuses on solving **business-critical problems** related to:
- Credit risk assessment
- Loan delinquency monitoring
- Fraud detection
- Customer segmentation
- Operational performance
- Regulatory compliance

All analytics and logic are implemented **purely using SQL**, mimicking production-grade data systems used in banks.

## Business Objective
Banks deal with massive transactional data and rely heavily on SQL-driven analytics for decision-making.

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to:
- Translate business problems into analytical queries
- Implement rule-based risk & fraud detection
- Create reusable analytics layers using views and stored procedures
- Optimize query performance for large datasets

---

## Case Studies Covered
1. Customer Credit Risk Profiling  
2. Loan Delinquency & Early Default Detection  
3. Fraud Detection Using Transaction Behavior  
4. Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing  
5. Branch & Channel Performance Analytics  
6. Regulatory & Compliance Monitoring (AML-style rules)

Each case study is implemented using **advanced SQL techniques** and documented with business context.
